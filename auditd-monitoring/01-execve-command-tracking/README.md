 # üêß Linux Auditd - execve syscall tracking

This project configures and uses Auditd on a Kali Linux VM to monitor system activity, specifically tracking commands executed via the `execve` syscall. This enables detection of all command-line executions, helping identify potentially malicious or unauthorized activity.

---

## üìå Objective

Track and log all command executions (like `ls`, `nano`, `ncat`, etc.) on the system using Linux‚Äôs native auditing tool, Auditd. This is useful in intrusion detection and understanding system behavior.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Setup

- **Auditd**: Linux audit daemon for monitoring system calls and changes.
- **Kali Linux** running on VirtualBox.
- **Root access** is required.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Steps Taken

### 1. Confirm Auditd Status  
Checked that `auditd` was active and running:

```bash
sudo systemctl status auditd

2. Verified auditctl Parameters
sudo auditctl -s
Ensured:
enabled was 1
failure was 0
backlog_limit was set to a number

3. Applied Syscall Rule
sudo auditctl -a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S execve -k command-track

4. Viewed Audit Logs
sudo ausearch -k command-track
This showed audit logs containing:
type=SYSCALL
type=PATH
type=PROCTITLE

indicating which command was executed and how.
